# NFL todo
    - Add SHAP
    - Add Keras-viz or Tensorboard?
    - Maybe add Scrapy to scrape current NFL game data ???
    - Add MLOPS (MLFlow, Pyspark streaming,...- see Udacity capstone and Pyspark stuff)
    - Remake the environment with cookie cutter
    - prep playby play dataset
    - find a pretrained model?



# Tools for Capstone
    - AutoML (AutoGluon, Pycaret... Autopilot)
    - SHAP - NN interpretation




# AWS ML

## Deep Learning

### Activation Functions
    - RELU, Leaky REUK, Prelu, Maxout - Backwards L-shape
    - Sofmax - multiple classification with output probabilities
    - Tahn - close to sigmoid
    - Simmoid - Binary classification - S-curve

### CNN
    - Convoutions (feature maps, ...)
    - RNN - sequential data (Language, Music, Ordering - even text) -- neron loops back and feeds back into the same neuron with the 'next' data
        + Topologies
             - Sequence to sequence - predict based on historical data
             - Sequence to vector - words in a sentence --> sentiment
             - Vector to sequence - captions from an image
             - Encoder Decoder --sequence-vector-sequence - ml translation
        - LSTM  - RNN favors more recent
        - GRU


Transformaers
    - Transfer Learning
        - fine-tune
        - replace head
        - replace outut layer
        - retrain from scratch with our own data

Evaluate
    - confusion matrix
    - recall - true positive rate:
             - TP / (TP + FN)
             - all from first column in confusion matrix
             - Sensitivity, Completeness <--care about false negatives - fraud detection don't want to miss any frauds
    - precision -correct positives rate
             - TP / (TP + FP)
             - all from top row in CM
             - care about false positives - medical screening
    - F1 - balanced
        - 2TP/ (2TP + FP + FN) or (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)

    - RMSE - sqrt(sum squred residuals)

    - ROC 



Neural Nets
   - Epochs
   - Batch size
   - Gradient Decent
   - Bck propagation
   - Loss function
   - Learning rate
   - Reguarization
   - Dropout Layers
   - Pooling layer
